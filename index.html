        <p class="aboutText">I am an entry-level web developer in the process of completing the University of Washington Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. But enough about that, let's talk about Megagames. <br><br> Four years ago Seattle Megagames, a local gaming group, formed.  I have been a member of it since the first game it ran, which bears with some explaining here, because Megagames are a very specific sort of game to experience.  It is a large scale (roughly 50 players, though they can range into the hundreds), in-person, multi-hour (most take all day) combination of live-action role playing (LARPing) and board games.  <br><br>The players are divided into teams, and into roles withing those teams.  The roles are responsible for playing different sections of the game - some might be spying on other teams, others might be commanding their armies against invading aliens, and still others may be engaging in scientific discovery to give them an edge within the game.  All of these sections have their own game mechanics.  One of my favorite mechanics involves having stickers that represent 'bugs' for spying, and having to hide them on the other team's materials, chairs, or selves.  Once they've got them set they start being able to intercept their communications, which are sent in a different section of the game.<br><br>Don't forget, this happens for hours on end, most often nine with an hour for lunch.  The entire time players are trying to figure out just what exactly the other teams are plotting, if they can trust them, and how best to outmaneuver everyone else in order to acheive their goals.  It's an intense experience, and takes a surprising level of endurance to see through to the end.<br><br>It's up to the Control team (that's me, and about a dozen others) to make sure that all of these different players and game sections run, and run well together. There are a lot of moving parts, all live, and a delay in any one of them can cascade into any and all other parts of the game.  It demands creativity to come up with solutions for player requests (blowing up the moon is surprisingly popular) on the fly in ways that work within the existing game and don't step on anyone else's fun.  The level of teamwork and quick thinking needed is substantial, and is excellent practice for high-pressure team scenarios.<br><br>Yeah, that's right, brought it back to a resume point.
