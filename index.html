            I am an entry-level web developer and a life-long puzzle solver. The
            latter, I believe, is the more important of the two, and is related
            to the former.<br /><br />Throughout my life I have enjoyed solving
            puzzles. Sometimes this is literal; one of my most common uses of
            our first computer when I was a child was to look up logic deduction
            challenges to solve for fun. I was a strange child - that has,
            perhaps, not changed much now.<br /><br />The puzzles, however, have
            become more varied since then, and often more loosely defined. For
            instance, my favorite part of multiple of my jobs was when I assumed
            the role of de-facto tech support, given that I was the only one
            present with the aptitude and confidence to dive in when things
            broke. One example is when everyone at one building I worked at who
            knew how to use the camera system left at the same time. No one left
            working there knew how to operate them, and though I was not
            stationed at that location full-time I was the one who sat down to
            puzzle it out. They ended up with a guide as to how to manage the
            monitoring and access control of the building again; I left having
            had a unusually fun day at work.<br /><br />In the web development
            field, I am still in the process of completing the University of
            Washington Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. My technology experience thus
            far includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Jquery, API usage, JSON,
            and Node. I will be continuing to develop back-end experience
            through the course, and am seeking to translate it to full-time
            employment in Seattle.
